# image-compressor
The project aimed at applying image compression techniques to compress video files. The techniques used were compression by the Fast Fourier Transform and the Discrete Cosine Transform. (The report)[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwAvbaQBGDt3ml_ZWJkPNBtKuwVaSJOHjIgTBwUSGdg/edit#heading=h.75rf4vta81ax] demonstrates the shortcomings of the Fast Fourier Transform as a tool for lossy compression.
